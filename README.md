# AyurChatbot API


## Overview
The AyurChatbot API is a Flask-based service designed to provide responses related to Ayurveda and healthcare based on Ayurvedic principles. This API uses the Groq client to generate responses and supports two main endpoints: /generate_response and /general-chat. Both endpoints require a specific authentication message in the request body to verify access.
